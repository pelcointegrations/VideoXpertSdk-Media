# VxSdk-Media

This repo contains the source code for the Pelco VideoXpert SDK Media Controller component.

### Note for x64 builds:
Due to the file size limit on GitHub you must manually unzip libgstlibav.zip located in VideoXpertSdkMedia/ThirdParty/GStreamer/1.14.4/x64/gstreamer_runtime/lib/gstreamer-1.0/ to that same directory. Streaming will fail if this file is unavailable in x64 applications.
